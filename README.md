# Superstar CV Template

superstar-cv-template-latex is just what it sounds like. A LaTeX template for a resume / curriculum vitae. It strictly separates the content from the structural template. In addition to the resume page you can showcase your certificates in a visually consistent manner.

 You can include your own content by either editing the content-dummy.tex or by creating your own content.tex file that you input in the main.tex instead of: 

```
\input{cv-content-dummy/content-dummy.tex}
```
